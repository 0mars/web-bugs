            Thank you for taking the time to report a problem with PHP.
            Unfortunately you are not using a current version of PHP -- 
            the problem might already be fixed. Please download a new
            PHP version from http://www.php.net/downloads.php

            If you are able to reproduce the bug with one of the latest
            versions of PHP, please change the PHP version on this bug report
            to the version you tested and change the status back to "Open".
            Again, thank you for your continued support of PHP.

            Please do not submit the same bug more than once. An existing
            bug report already describes this very problem. Even if you feel
            that your issue is somewhat different, the resolution is likely
            to be the same. Because of this, we hope you add your comments
            to the original bug instead.

            We are sorry, but can not support PHP 3 related problems anymore.
            Momentum is gathering for PHP 5, and we think supporting PHP 3 will
            lead to a waste of resources which we want to put into getting PHP 5
            ready. Ofcourse PHP 4 will will continue to be supported for the
            forseeable future.
